	  + original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
0.1.2b  Fri Dec 07 2012
	  + added the initial support for printing with newlines.  
0.1.3b  Fri Dec 07 2012
 	  + added support for color printing.
                - may merge the color printing methods with the original method in the near future.  
0.1.3.1 Fri Dec 07 2012
	  - updated the manpages substantially and decided to move from beta to release, no real differences in support or execution.  (Could have left beta sooner?)
0.1.3.2 Fri Dec 07 2012
	  - More cosmetic changes, all probably related to the manpages, which took forever to get right, imo.  
0.1.3.3 Tue Dec 11 2012
	  +- Working on adding support for a quiet println function that will not return any warnings whatsoever--specifically designed to help with using the Text::UpsideDown module.
